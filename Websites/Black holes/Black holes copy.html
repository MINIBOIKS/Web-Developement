    <h1> Black Holes </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> What is a black hole? </h2>
    
    
     <span> 
    <p> 
      A black hole is a whole sector of a really vigorous gravitational area where not even 1  human or anything can escape.  <br>
        This pull is even more intense than it is down here on earth. On earth we have gravity that is strong enough to keep <br>
        us on the ground and not fly around.  A black hole in this case is similar but deadly. This can pull you down the <br>                             
        instant you get near it and never be able to get out. Well here's something more mind blowing! This is so strong it <br> 
        can even pull any source of light. When I think of this I think that as the  Universe slowly separates the sun may <br> 
        get close enough to the hole and be pulled in. Now, there are different types of black holes.  They can be categorized by <br>
        the different masses they have. Before I get to that, This image here is the first ever image they got of the black hole. <br>
        This was taken on April 10th 2017.  You may wonder why this image is really blurry. This is because they had captured this <br>
        from about 500 million trillion km away.  All of the black holes are in the center of the galaxy. There is 1 important thing <br> 
        about all black holes. They are all pitch black inside. The center of our galaxy is called the Sagittarius A (Sa- ge turious)<br>
        Which is also known as a black hole. This has a mass of about 4 million suns and also has a diameter of the distance between <br> 
        earth and our sun. So about  148.03 million km long.

     <h2> How is it created? </h2>
     <p>A Black hole is created when a star dies. When it dies it explodes into tiny pieces. Those pieces form into a small circle and <br>
        make a black hole.  After this gets created it becomes the most powerful black hole!!! Then you know what happens next. It <br> 
        just pulls in things close to it.<br> </p>
      <br>
      <br>
        <h2> Here is a diagram of a black hole capturing a star:</h2>
             <img src="Black hole.jpeg" height="312" width="552">

             <p>According to this diagram there is a star and the black hole. Then it is showing the star being ripped apart to pull it<br> 
                in.  As the star gets pulled in it comes like a huge thick line and goes into the disk. When it gets closer and closer it <br>
                turns into a particle jet and goes in.<br></p>
                 

                <h2> Temperature in the black hole: </h2>
                 <p> All Black holes are exceedingly cold. They have a temperature of lower than 0 Kelvin. This in degrees celsius would be <br>
                     -273.15 degrees! The only time black holes get this cold or colder is because of the size. As this gets bigger by <br> 
                     sucking in more stars and objects it gets bigger, and the bigger it is the colder it will be. This black hole here is <br>
                     the one with -273.15 degrees. Since this was taken in the year of 2017, it would now be way larger and colder. That <br>
                     temperature is not to be found yet. (I cannot find it) just like it is cold on the inside of the Black hole, on the <br>
                     outside it is so hot! The outside of the black hole can be about a million degrees because the things the black hole <br>
                     pulls in collide together making it hot. WHOA!<br> </p>
                     
                   <h2> What happens in a black hole?:</h2>  
                   <p> As you know that a black hole has strong gravity and anything cannot get out when you go in. So, no matter what type <br>
                    of black hole you fall into, you're going to instantly get torn apart by the extreme gravity. Nothing, not even we can not<br>
                     survive that. So once you pass the edge of the Event Horizon, you're nothing but a ghost. There's no getting out because <br> 
                     it tears you away! <br></p>
                   
                   <h2>When was this discovered: </h2>
                   <p> This black hole was discovered in 1916 by Karl Schwarzschild. In 1958 the fact that nothing can escape the black hole <br>
                     was published by David Finkelstien.<br> 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>Importance to Space:</h2>
                    <p>I think that this is important to space since some scientists think that they might be the one holding up our planets.<br>
                         So if the black hole were not created the way they are we might not even have a sun.<br></p>
