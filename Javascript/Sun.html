        <b>What is a Sun and Why do we need it?</b> 
        <br>
        <br>

        The sun is basically a star. But it's just bigger than the other stars, but I am not saying that the sun is the biggest. It’s just the biggest in our solar system. Out of our solar system there may be more bigger stars.A sun is something that gives all planets light and heat. The sun is the important source of energy for life on earth. Without the sun plants cannot complete their photosynthesis cycle. The sun plays an important part in keeping plants alive because it needs nutrients and proteins to make oxygen, to help it grow, and make defences to keep it safe. 
        Us humans need the sun because it gives us light and heat. Without it earth would lose light, and will be pitch dark even at night time because the moon reflects the light from the sun to earth. The Sun is one of the most important parts that helps earth orbit. Because of the sun’s gravitational pull, earth is always in the right orbit and stays in it’s position without rolling away. If the sun disappears earth will start losing heat. Which causes earth to go to -273 °C(we cannot survive if it's this cold and all the water would freeze. This would make earth a non-life planet.)

        <b> How was the sun created and how is it important to Space?</b>
         <br>
         <br>
        
        
        The sun was created when a cloud of dust and gas was disturbed  by an explosion from a nearby star called the super Nova. When it exploded its waves traveled everywhere. These clouds were squished together by the waves and caused it to collapse . Because it collapsed the little pieces of matter started going away from it but a strong gravity pull from the explosion pulled it back. Then, the circle started spinning at a tremendous speed.  At the heart of the  nebula there was a  ball of hydrogen gas who’s pressure and temperature became really high. Finally there was our newborn sun.  From the sources I used and from what I know there are many stars and universes in space so the sun is just helpful for our solar system. If we did not have the sun, there wouldn’t be any planets in our solar system.

        <b> Measurements of our sun and what is it made up of?</b>
        <br>
         <br>
        -Diameter of sun: 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles)
        <br>
        -Its mass is about 330,000 times than Earth
        <br>
        - ts mass is about 330,000 times than Earth
        <br>
         -sun is made up of 2 octillion tons of gas
         <br>
        -The sun's core pressure: 260 billion more than earths surface.
        <br>
        -Suns cores heat: 5 million degrees Celsius
        <br>
         <br>
        
        
       <b> Fun facts (From internet):</b>
        <br>
         <br>
        -Every second of every day the sun converts 700 million tons of hydrogen into 695 million ons of helium.
        <br>
    
        The Sun looks like a burning ball of fire, but it actually has an internal structure. <br> The visible surface we can see is called the photosphere, and heats up to a temperature of about 6,000 degrees Kelvin. <br> Beneath that is the convective zone, where heat moves slowly from the inner Sun to the surface, and cooled material falls back down in columns. <br>This region starts at 70% of the radius of the Sun. <br> Beneath the convection zone is the radiative zone. In this zone, heat can only travel through radiation.  <br>The core of the Sun extends from the center of the Sun to a distance of 0.2 solar radii. <br> This is where temperatures reach 13.6 million degrees Kelvin, and molecules of hydrogen are fused into helium. <br>

       <b> Do people pray the sun?</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Yes, people in every culture pray the sun as god. So do I! There are different names for praying the sun like:
        <br>
         Tamil : suryan, kathiravan, and more names
         <br>
        Latin:Sol
        <br>
        greek:Helios                                        
        <br>
        Egyptian: RA
        <br>
        German:Sonne
        <br>
        Greek(Modern):ilios
