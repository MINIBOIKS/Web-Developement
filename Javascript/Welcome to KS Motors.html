    <h1>Welcome to KS Motors</h1>
    <h2>Our Newest Creation:</h2>
      <p>Hello! This is Karthick the owner of KS Motors today I am here to introduce our brand new product. The Idle car heater! This heater can heat your car in cold days during the winter. When there is no sun there is a 20 watt LED light that can act as the sun using the cars battery. You all may think how can a 20 watt LED light can be bright. Well a simple explanation is that LED lights are actually brighter than other lights and they also produce heat! Don't worry about your car battery running out because it takes a car battery 20-70 hours to lose full charge on a 20 watt LED light! We also used thermal glass which are used on phones and greenhouses! (they are powerful glasses that cannot break easily.)
