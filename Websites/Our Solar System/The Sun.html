    <h2> What is a Sun and Why do we need it?</h2>
    <p>The Sun is the biggest Star in our Solar System. Out of our solar system there are many bigger stars. A sun gives all the planets that are orbiting it light and heat. <br>
    The sun is an important source of energy for life on earth. Without the sun plants cannot complete their photosynthesis cycle. The sun plays an important part in keeping <br> 
    plants alive because it needs nutrients and proteins to make oxygen, to help it grow, and make defenses to keep it safe. The Sun helps earth orbit. Because of the sun’s <br>
    gravitational pull, earth is always in the right position and stays in its position. If the sun disappears earth will start losing heat. Which causes Life on earth to <br>
    disappear. Earth will then be called a non-life planet.</p>

    <h2>Measurements of our sun and what its made up of</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Diameter of sun: 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles)</li>
    <li>Its mass is about 330,000 times than Earth</li>
    <li>sun is made up of 2 octillion tons of gas</li>
    <li>The sun's core pressure: 260 billion more than earth’s surface.</li>
    <li>Sun’s core’s heat: 5 million degrees Celsius</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Fun facts</h2>
   
   <p>Every second of every day the sun converts 700 million tons of hydrogen into 695 million ons of helium.
    The Sun looks like a burning ball of fire, but it actually has an internal structure. The visible surface we can see is called the photosphere, and heats up to a temperature <br>
    of about 6,000 degrees Kelvin. Beneath that is the convective zone, where heat moves slowly from the inner Sun to the surface, and cooled material falls back down in columns.<br>
     This region starts at 70% of the radius of the Sun. Beneath the convection zone is the radiative zone. In this zone, heat can only travel through radiation. The core of the <br>
     Sun extends from the center of the Sun to a distance of 0.2 solar radii. This is where temperatures reach 13.6 million degrees Kelvin, and molecules of hydrogen are fused into helium.

    <h2>How was the sun created and how is it important to Space?</h2> 
    <p>The sun was created when a cloud of dust and gas was disturbed  by an explosion from a nearby star called the super Nova. When it exploded its waves traveled everywhere. <br>
     These clouds were put together by the waves and caused it to collapse . When  it collapsed the little pieces of matter started leaving it, but a strong gravity pull from <br>
     the explosion did not let them leave.  At the heart of the  nebula there was a  ball of hydrogen gas who’s pressure and temperature became Extremely  high. Then there was <br> 
     our newborn sun.  If we did not have the sun, there wouldn’t be any planets in our solar system. </p>
